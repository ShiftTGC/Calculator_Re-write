# Calculator_Re-write
A rewrite of a Java-based Calculator I wrote with help from RexTheCapt. This time, I write it solo.

A basic Java Command Prompt based calculator. Cuz why not?
(Requires Java 8 or higher)

to run it (on Windows 10), download the Jar file and open Command Prompt.
In Command Prompt, type "Java - jar" and drag and drop in the file.
It should look something like this:
"Java -jar C:\Users\Shift\Desktop\ShiftsCalculator.jar"

Hit enter and then you are running the program.
